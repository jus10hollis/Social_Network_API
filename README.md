Next, run `npm start' so that the application listens on localhost. To test the create, read, update, and delete functions, users should open Insomnia and run the API's POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE routes.

## Technologies used
This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The application also uses the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps. The application leverages a NoSQL database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
